# Pro Audio Linux Machine
I created this guide to assist with commissioning a new OS installation for a Linux-based Pro Audio machine.

For this project, I chose Debian 12 (Bookworm) with the KDE Plasma desktop environment. There are many Linux distributions available, but I selected this one for several key reasons:

1)Stability and Security: Debian 12 is a stable operating system known for its reliability and robust performance—essential qualities for a Pro Audio workstation. It also provides access to a vast software repository.

2)Long-Term Support: Debian 12 is expected to receive updates until at least June 2028, making it a solid choice for long-term projects.

3)Balanced Software Selection: In my view, Debian 12 comes with just the right number of pre-installed applications—enough to be functional out of the box, without unnecessary bloat.

4)User-Friendly Desktop Environment: KDE Plasma offers a familiar and intuitive interface, making it a smooth transition for users coming from Windows or macOS.
